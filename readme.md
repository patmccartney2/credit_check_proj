1. What do you need to improve?
I need to improve on starting my projects earlier and spreading the work out more throughout the week,.
1. What questions do you still have?


# Rubric

## Functionality

Notes:

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:

The student(s):

- [4] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [4] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [3] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [4] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [3] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [4] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [4] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [33] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [4] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [4] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [1] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [3] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [4] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [2] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [3] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
